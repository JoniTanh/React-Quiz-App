#Quiz Game App w/ React, Vite, ESLint & Tailwind

## About

This React Quiz Game is a quiz application that draws inspiration from "The 1% Club" game show, merging the challenges of trivia with the flexibility of modern web technology. The application is developed using React, Vite, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS, aiming to create a smooth and user-friendly experience. Unlike the traditional format of "The 1% Club," this quiz offers players four answer choices for each question, adding more strategic thinking and decision-making elements to the game.

### Inspiration

The central source of inspiration for this game is "The 1% Club," a quiz show known for its intriguing and challenging questions. The unique feature of this application is the introduction of multiple-choice questions, providing players with a more guided and immersive participation in the quizzes. This approach seeks to make the game more approachable and enjoyable for a diverse audience, from casual players to passionate trivia enthusiasts.

### Project Setup
